Explanation

The first column is an alphabetically ordered list of Doctor names.
The second column is an alphabetically ordered list of Professor names.
The third column is an alphabetically ordered list of Singer names.
The fourth column is an alphabetically ordered list of Actor names.
The empty cell data for columns with less than the maximum number of names per occupation (in this case, the Professor and Actor columns) are filled with NULL values.



The solution: 
SELECT  
min(case when Occupation = 'DOCTOR' then NAME else NULL end),
min(case when Occupation = 'PROFESSOR' then NAME else NUll end),
min(case when Occupation = 'SINGER' then NAME else Null end),
min(case when Occupation = 'ACTOR' then NAME else Null end)
from (SELECT OCCUPATION, NAME, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY OCCUPATION ORDER BY NAME) AS OCC
FROM OCCUPATIONS) as HACK
group by OCC
